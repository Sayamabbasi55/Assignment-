Problem Statement
Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum. The program should perform the following tasks:

solution
def main():
    # Prompt the user to enter the first number
    first_number = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
    
    # Prompt the user to enter the second number
    second_number = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
    
    # Calculate the sum of the two numbers
    total_sum = first_number + second_number
    
    # Print the total sum with an appropriate message
    print(f"The sum of {first_number} and {second_number} is: {total_sum}")
# Call the main function
main()
